# TwitterDapp
Decentralized twitter application using thirdweb

## About the app
This app was made as part of a learning attempt to deploy a smart contract in thirdweb.  
The smart contract is easily understandable as it's not too much complex and only uses existing methods to make a twitter Dapp. 

## Running the app
Ensure you have thirdweb installed in your system. To install thirdweb(https://thirdweb.com/) you can visit their website
