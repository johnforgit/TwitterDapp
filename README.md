# TwitterDapp

2. [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)

## Running the Dapp
1. After installing all the requirements create a contract using thirdweb
2. For creating a contract : ```npx thirdweb create --contract```
3. For creating an app : ```npx thirdweb create --app```
4. You can also use the command ```npx thirdweb@latest create```  
   In case you use this command every thirdweb command hereafter should have ```npx thirdweb@latest``` in it
5. After the successful creation of your contract you can deploy it by : ```Javascript
   npx thirdweb deploy```
